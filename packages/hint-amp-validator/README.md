# AMP HTML validator (`amp-validator`)

> AMP HTML is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and
fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as
painfully slow page load times â€“ especially when reading content on
the mobile web. AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an
AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.

***From [AMPProject - AMP HTML][ampproject]***

## Why is this important?

If you are building an AMP page, you need to make sure the HTML is
valid. Only valid AMP content can be added to an [AMP Cache][amp-cache].

## What does the hint check?

This hint uses [amphtml-validator][amphtml-validator] to validate the
HTML of your page.

## Can the hint be configured?

Yes, you can decide if you want to receive errors only, or also
warnings found by [`amphtml-validator`][amphtml-validator].
By default, all warnings and errors are reported. If you prefer to
see only the errors, you can use the following hint configuration
in your [`.hintrc`][hintrc] file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "amp-validator": ["error", {
            "errorsOnly": true
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

## How to use this hint?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @hint/hint-amp-validator --save-dev
```

**Note:** The recommended way of running webhint is as a `devDependency` of
your project.

And then activate it via the [`.hintrc`][hintrc] configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "amp-validator": "error",
        ...
    },
    "parsers": [...],
    ...
}
```
